# clinical-trial-analysis

# Overview
This project analyzes a clinical trial dataset to see how a new medication affects HbA1c levels compared to a placebo. It also looks at patient demographics and diabetes duration to understand treatment effectiveness.

# Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Excel

# Process
Cleaned and verified patient data  
Compared treatment and placebo groups  
Analyzed response differences by age, sex, and diabetes duration  
Created charts to summarize efficacy and safety

# Key Takeaways
The new medication reduced HbA1c significantly compared to placebo  
Results were consistent across most demographic groups  
Patients with shorter diabetes duration responded slightly better  
Mild adverse events noted; no major safety concerns

# Dataset
Simulated clinical trial data with patient demographics, HbA1c readings, and treatment information.
